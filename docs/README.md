# Docs

Welcome to the docs of Flat: Fleet Live Area Tracking.

## Structure of Application and Docs

The Flat app family is split into three main parts:

-   [Android Frontend](/docs/frontend-android/README.md)
-   [PWA Frontend](/docs/frontend-pwa/README.md) (Progressive Web App)
-   [Backend](/docs/backend/README.md) (Shared by both frontends)

Likewise, the codebase and therefore the docs are split in the same manner.

The API is defined seperately in the [API Docs](/docs/api.md).
