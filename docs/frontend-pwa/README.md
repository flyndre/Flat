# PWA Frontend

This frontend for the Flat app is implemented using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
For visuals, [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) are utilized.

## Project Structure

The PWA Frontend is structured like most Vue applications.
For maximum clarity, the following bullet list assigns each folder inside the project its associated usage.

-   `public/`
    For global static assets like the icon or a manifest.
-   `src/`
    For project parts that have to be built/imported before deployment.
    -   `api/`
        For working with the REST/Websocket APIs
    -   `assets/`
        For static but imported assets like JSON or images.
    -   `components/`
        For atomic components, like a button.
    -   `data/`
        For all data-related files such as client-side storage access or constants.
    -   `layouts/`
        For compositions of components like a nav bar.
    -   `plugins/`
        For custom Vue Plugins.
    -   `router/`
        For the Vue Router configuration.
    -   `service/`
        For async services such as position logging.
    -   `types/`
        For TypeScript type declarations.
    -   `util/`
        For supporting functionality such as conversion functions and alike.
    -   `validation/`
        For validation functions.
    -   `views/`
        For sub-page layouts used in Vue Router.
